Flyball Master runs a Tournament within the NAFA rules. Tournament details, club information, teams, schedule, Judges Dashboard, C2 Forms and reports, intra race labels, and an innovative race update web site are available in the current version of Flyball Master.

Development of the software is being done in NAFA region 13. The software is in development with the first release expected in early 2016.

This site is used to manage the documentation of the software. A website is in progress and will be posted here shortly.

If you use the software and have any suggestions, please open an issue and we'll have a look at the request/bug.
